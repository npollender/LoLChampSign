# LoLChampSign

An LED powered sign that dynamically changes the color of each letter according to the four previously played champions in League of Legends. Additionally, if the player is currently in-game, the letter 'K' cycles colors in a rainbow pattern.

I used the versatile ESP8266 microcontroller, it has built-in Wi-Fi and can power and control the LED strip with no issue.

This project was made possible by the LoL API provided by Riot Games. https://developer.riotgames.com/
